			<h3>Multinational Companies</h3>
			<p>A multinational corporation (MNC) has facilities and other assets in at least one country other than its home country. A multinational company generally has offices and/or factories in different countries and a centralized head office where they coordinate global management. Some of these companies, also known as international, stateless, or transnational corporate organizations, may have budgets that exceed those of some small countries.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="job-col">
			<h3>Work From Home</h3>
			<p>Work From Home means an employee is working from their house, apartment, or place of residence, rather than working from the office. Many companies have a WFH policy, or remote work policy, that allows their employees to work from home either full-time or when it's most convenient for them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="job-col">
			<h3>Local Hiring</h3>
			<p>Local hiring is a goal or requirement to hire people who live close to the place of work. This aim is often more specifically structured as a requirement for contractors awarded certain types of publicly funded projects to recruit a certain proportion of the people working on the project from a particular area.</p>

	<h4>About Us</h4>
	<p>Say you asked us How Purveyor started as we’re heading into work on Monday. We’d probably tell you it was created to fuse the power of AI data analytics with insightful, real human coaching to revolutionize the way people build careers. But, ask us on Friday afternoon and we’ll tell you we wanted to build a job dating service, except instead of a person, you’re falling in love with your job. </p>
